# RandA PhotoSharing
RandA PhotoSharing is an application designed to show all the capabilities of ther RandA board:
It lets you use togheter all the high level of abstraction capabilities of RaspBerry and the low level capabilities of Arduino.

#How it works
The user is invited to use the application and take a photo, adding various image effects to it and to hold some poles which will measure some thematic properties: for example you can measure cleverness, beauty, or love between two people.
Arduino measures the conductivity between the poles in order to output a value, it also tracks and handles the input provided by 3 buttons.
The user is then asked if he wants to publish his picture on social networks, or receive it via eMail.
In this specific application we host a website using RaspBerry, which serves as a control panel to configure every text which is displayed, along with the position of logos and graphics overlayed to the final picture.
It allows control on which social networks the photo will be published on, or the sucbject and body of the email sent to the user.
It's also possible to keep track of all the taken photos, and the inserted eMail addresses and to export them in an Excel file for statistical and marketing purposes.

To learn more about how it works or how to build it and set it up, read the README.pdf file in this repository.
